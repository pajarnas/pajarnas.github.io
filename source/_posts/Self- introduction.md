Hi, my name is Saige. I have been working in the **field** of full **stack** developer for about 5 years. In the past five years, I have built some Web applications and Web APIs. C**#** is my **primary** programming language and I am also compatible with Java and **Python**.



For the backend technology in my most **recent** projects, I used ASP .NET Core, **Entity** Framework Core, Dapper and MVC 5. I used SQL Server as a database but I'm also good with MySql and PostgreSql.



For the frontend, I **usually** use **Angular** framework along with **H**TML5, CSS3, **Angular** **bootstrap**, **Angular** **Material**. I also have plenty of experience in Unit Testing and **mocking**.



In my last project , I built an SPA Web Application to implement a Hotel management system for the hotel managers and customers . I made a significant contribution to the application because of my expertise in angular framework.
