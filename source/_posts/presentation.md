**TUMOR CLASSIFICATION PROGRAM**

By: Shiqi Zhang

**Specific purpose** : My speech will inform my audience about the tumor classification program by examining what technology it is based on, how it works, and its potential impacts.

# Introduction


## Hook


I am going to introduce a tumor classification program. At first, imagine a doctor finally tells a woman who is having a child in the body, say, &quot;you are not pregnant.&quot; Or even worse, he said, &quot;you are pregnant&quot; to a man. That is called misdiagnosis.

### I am gonna talk about some stories to inform this topic. So why is this program needed? (transition)


## Introduce topic


I will start with the numbers. &quot;1.5 million people around the world die each year due to misdiagnoses. (pg1,Olesch)

AI technology can assist doctors in making the right decision. (pg1, Olesch)

## Audience Relation

Although the topics like cancer, the tumor is a far from us, there are still many people suffering from cancer worldwide.

## Ethos Statement

There are two main results due to various misdiagnoses about tumor. For example, some healthy people may be told by doctors that they got cancer, but their tumors are actually benign because of misdiagnoses. Unfortunately, some actual cancer patients were told that they are healthy. They probably missed the best time to treat cancer for that.

## Thesis

Therefore, that is why the medical systems or hospitals needed this technology to correct the potential errors.

## Preview


Beneficial from the development of AI technology, tumor classification is positively working with the doctors and reducing the possibility of misdiagnosis.

### (Before we started talking about the program, we need to know what technology it is based on.)

# **Main Body Point One – Base technology**

A scientist named Alan Turing is widely considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. Alan Turing invented the machine to decrypt German messages in the Second World War. This machine could classify enormous amounts of information to find a solution that a human being could not achieve on his own (para. 27, GUTIÉRREZ). You may notice those machines can deal with a large number of data. Right now, the machine can learn these data by itself. The machine or program can gain experience and perform better at the next prediction by feeding massive data. (para. 1, Brownlee )The more data you feed the program, the brighter it becomes. It is so intelligent that he can read written digit, make a classification for the cat and dogs, and predict house price with high accuracy.

### (The scientists applied this machine learning to medical research.)

# **Main Body Point Two – How it works**

The hospital all over the world is producing tumor images day by day. The images can be labeled doctors with the malignant and benign. Then scientists gathered the images into an extensive dataset. Let&#39;s say thousands of images of malignant tumor images and benign images. Then, scientists divide the data into two-part, one called training data, the other is testing data. Scientists use trained data to feed the program, and after training, use test data to calculate the accuracy(pg.25, Esteva). By the accuracy, the scientist adjusts the model to get better accuracy. When the accuracy is higher than 90 percent, the model is ready to use.

### (At the clinical, the doctor used this program to analyze whether the patient&#39;s tumor is malignant or benign)

# **Main Body Point Three – impacts**

At this time, the model is correcting himself all the time. No one can deny that this program can save more lives than before. People would argue that is it possible that doctors could be replaced with AI programs someday? The answer is no. Because the AI is still an assistant that can only deal with one specific question, real-life consists of many different situations. Doctors need to consider many different situations which AI program could not deal with.

### ( In conclusion, today, we learned about the tumor classification program)

# **Conclusion**

## Summary: 

Today, we have learned that AI technology can help doctors to classify the tumor. We learned how it works and what it is future impacts.

## Round-off: 

This program will help more and more medical workers to give better solutions to patients.
